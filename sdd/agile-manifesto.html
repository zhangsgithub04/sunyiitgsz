                waterfall: `TRADITIONAL (Waterfall) APPROACH:
- Strict adherence to SDLC process
- Heavy documentation required before coding
- Developers communicate through formal documents
- Tools dictate how team works
- "Follow the process, not the people"

Example:
Developer: "I found a critical issue in requirements."
Manager: "We're in the coding phase. File a change request and wait for approval."
[3 weeks later, change request approved]
Result: Problem discovered early, fixed late`,
                agile: `AGILE APPROACH:
- Team collaboration over rigid process
- Face-to-face communication preferred
- Processes adapted to team needs
- Tools serve the team's workflow
- "Trust the team to self-organize"

Example:
Developer: "I found a critical issue in requirements."
Product Owner (sitting nearby): "Let's discuss it now."
[5-minute conversation]
Team pivots immediately, fixes issue same day
Result: Problem discovered early, fixed early`,

SCENARIO:
Team discovers payment gateway doesn't support Apple Pay (a new requirement from customers).

PROCESS-HEAVY RESPONSE:
1. Formal change request submitted
2. Change control board meets (next Tuesday)
3. Impact analysis document created
4. Approval chain: PM → Director → VP
5. Timeline: 2-3 weeks
Result: Delay, frustrated customers

PEOPLE-FOCUSED RESPONSE:
1. Developer talks to Product Owner immediately
2. Quick huddle with payment team
3. Spike solution explored same day
4. Decision made in 1 hour
5. Implementation starts next day
Result: Fast pivot, happy customers

- 200-page requirements specification
- Detailed design documents for every module
- No coding until all docs approved
- Documentation updated separately from code
- Measuring progress by documents completed

Example Project Timeline:
Month 1-2: Requirements (150 pages)
Month 3-4: Design (100 pages)
Month 5-6: Coding begins
Month 7: Integration
Month 8: Testing discovers requirements misunderstood

Result: Months of documentation, delayed working software`,

- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Just-enough documentation
- Working software every 2 weeks
- Documentation generated from code (API docs)
- Measuring progress by working features

Example Project Timeline:
Week 1-2: First feature working
Week 3-4: Second feature working
Week 5-6: Third feature working
Each iteration: stakeholders see and use software
Continuous feedback loop

Result: Fast value delivery, early validation`,

COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION APPROACH:
Project: Add money transfer feature
Documentation Created:
• 50-page requirements specification
• 30-page UI/UX design document
• 25-page technical architecture document
• 20-page API specification
• 15-page test plan

Timeline: 6 weeks of documentation
Then: Started coding
Problem: When users saw prototype, they wanted completely different flow
Result: 6 weeks of documentation wasted, major rework

WORKING SOFTWARE APPROACH:
Week 1: Built basic transfer prototype
Week 2: Users tested and provided feedback
   "We want to save favorite recipients"
   "Add a confirmation step"
Week 3: Implemented feedback, deployed to beta
Week 4: Production release
Documentation: 
   - API docs auto-generated from code
   - User guide (5 pages)
   - Architecture decision records (3 pages)

Result: Feature in production in 4 weeks with exactly what users needed`,

- Fixed-price, fixed-scope contract
- All requirements locked in upfront

"Build e-commerce platform with these 50 features for $500K"
Month 6: Customer sees demo
Customer: "Can we add wish lists? Our competitors have it."

Result: Happy customer, evolving scope, maximum value`,

CONTRACT NEGOTIATION APPROACH:
Client signs $2M contract for:
  ✓ Patient registration
  ✓ Appointment scheduling  
  ✓ Electronic health records
  ✓ Billing system
  ✓ Inventory management

Month 8 (during testing):
Client: "We need COVID-19 screening workflows!"

Vendor: "That's not in the contract. Change order: $200K, 4 months."
Client: "But we need this NOW for patient safety!"
Vendor: "We're building what you signed."

Result: System delivered on time, immediately obsolete

COLLABORATION APPROACH:
Client partners with team for $2M, 18-month timeline

Monthly reviews with priorities:
Sprint 10 (when pandemic hits):
Client: "COVID screening is now our #1 priority."
Team: "Let's pause inventory management and build screening."

FOLLOWING THE PLAN:
January 2020 Plan:
Q1: User profiles and friends
Q2: Photo sharing
Q3: Events and groups
Q4: Marketplace

March 2020: Pandemic hits
Users need: Video calls, virtual events, online collaboration
Plan says: Build marketplace in Q4

Leadership: "Stick to the plan. Marketplace is scheduled for Q4."
[Team builds features nobody needs while competitors add video]
December: Marketplace launches
Reality: Users have moved to competitors with video features

Result: Followed plan perfectly, lost market share

RESPONDING TO CHANGE:
January 2020 Plan (flexible):
Vision: Connect people
Next: User profiles and friends

March 2020: Pandemic hits, sprint review reveals:
Users: "We need to stay connected remotely!"
